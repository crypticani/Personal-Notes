# Introduction to Data Warehousing
- A Datawarehouse is the repository of a data and it is used for Management decision support system. Datawarehouse consists of wide variety of data that has high level of business conditions at a single point in time.
- In single sentence, it is repository of integrated information which can be available for queries and analysis.

## What is a dimensional table?
- Dimensional tables include textual attributes of measurement saved in the fact tables. A dimensional table is a group of hierarchies, categories, and logic which can be used for the customer to traverse in hierarchy nodes.

## DBMS Schemas for Decision Support
- Star Schema
  - It has
    - one large central table(facttable)
    - set of smaller tables(dimensions)
    - arranged in a radial pattern around the central table
- Snowflake schema
  - decomposing one or more of the dimensions.
  - The decomposed snow flake structure visualizes the hierarchical structure of dimensions very well.
- Fact constellation schema
  - splitting the original star schema into more star schemes. each of them describes facts on another level of dimension hierarchies

## Data extraction, cleanup & Transformation tools

### EXTRACT
- Process of extract the relevant data from the operational database before bringing into the data warehouse.

### Transformation
- Smoothing: remove noise from data
- Aggregation: summarization, data cube construction
- Generalization: concept hierarchy climbing 
- Normalization: scaled to fall within a small, specified range – min-max normalization – z-score normalization – normalization by decimal scaling 

### Cleaning
#### Data cleaning tasks 
- Fill in missing values
- Identify outliers and smooth out noisy data
- Correct inconsistent data

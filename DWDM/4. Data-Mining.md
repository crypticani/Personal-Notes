# Data Mining
- Data Mining is set to be a process of analyzing the data in different dimensions or perspectives and summarizing into a useful information. 
- Can be queried and retrieved the data from database in their own format.
- Data mining is the phase of analysing data from several perspectives and summarizing it into useful data.

## Techniques of Data Mining

- Tracking/Sequential patterns
  - This is usually a recognition of some aberration in your data happening at regular intervals
- Classification
  - forces you to collect various attributes together into discernable categories, which you can then use to draw further conclusions, or serve some function.
- Association
  - Association is related to tracking patterns, but is more specific to dependently linked variables. 
  - In this case, youâ€™ll look for specific events or attributes that are highly correlated with another event or attribute
- Outlier detection
  - 
- Clustering
  - grouping chunks of data together based on their similarities
- Regression
  - used primarily as a form of planning and modeling, is used to identify the likelihood of a certain variable, given the presence of other variables.
- Prediction
  - In many cases, just recognizing and understanding historical trends is enough to chart a somewhat accurate prediction of what will happen in the future.

# Decision Tree
- A decision tree is a diagram or chart that helps determine a course of action or show a statistical probability.
- Each branch of the decision tree represents a possible decision, outcome, or reaction. The furthest branches on the tree represent the end results of a certain decision pathway.
- People use decision trees in a variety of situations, such as determining a course of action for a complex finance or business decision.

# Neural Networks
- Neural networks are a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data.
- They are used in a variety of applications in financial services, from forecasting and marketing research to fraud detection and risk assessment.

### 3 methods or learning paradigms to teach a neural network.
- Supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
  - In this, learning of input-output mapping is done by continuous interaction with the environment
- Unsupervised Learning

# Genetic Algorithms
- Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. 
- It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. 
- It is frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning.
- Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are search based algorithms based on the concepts of natural selection and genetics.
